# ShaderProject
This project contains a wide variety of different shaders that I have found interesting
The format is as follows:
- Each shader will get its own folder
- Folders naming convention is: <A descrptiv name>-<Type of the shader>-<Version of GLSL needed>-<Author>-<Date: MM-DD-YYYY>
- each folder contains 1 shader, 1 GLIB file, 4 screenshots (figures), 1 description
- Shaders could be of types:
-- Vertex
-- Geometry
-- Tessellation Control
-- Tessellation Evaluation
-- Fragment
-- Compute
- Shaders are coded exclusivly in GLSL
- GLIB file is a GLMan compatiblity file. For more information, please refer to (http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~mjb/glman/)
- Folder is required to contain 4 screenshots (figures) describing the effect
- Each figure's name should describe what is happening or it needs to have a caption
- A ".md" file called "Description.md", that describes all the effects, uniform variables and potential use cases for each shader. it must include:
-- Title
-- Author
-- Date: MM-DD-YYYY
-- Type of the shader
-- Version of GLSL needed
-- Uniform variables
-- Effect of changing each Uniform variable (refrence the figures and screenshots)
-- Potential use cases for the shader

Disclaimers:
The Shader Project: I don't claim The Shader Project is good for anything - if you think it is, great, but it's up to you to decide. If The Shader Project doesn't work: tough. If you lose a million because The Shader Project messes up, it's you that's out of the million, not me If you don't like this disclaimer: tough. I reserve the right to do the absolute minimum provided by law, up to and including nothing. Do not distribute The Shader Project for profit! (seriously!). This is basically the same disclaimer that comes with all software packages, but mine is in plain English and theirs is in legalese. I didn't really want to include a disclaimer at all, but my lawyer insisted. I tried to ignore her but she threatened me with the shark attack at which point I relented. Download and use this project at your own risk. I take no responsibility for anything.
